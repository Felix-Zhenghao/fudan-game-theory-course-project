The python implementation of a finitely repeated game with demand inertia.<br>

### How to play the game
You can directly read the source/main.py and can understand the implementation because I've added huge amount of comments in the code file.<br>
If you want to play the game with your friends, directly download the main.py on your laptop.<br>
Remember to install python packages needed to run the code. So far, only numpy is needed.<br>
```python
pip install numpy
import numpy as np
```

Enjoy!
